Multiclass Classification Problem consists of 5 Classes of NEWS,<br>
Sports,Tech, Politics, Business, and Entertainment. <br>
Dataset Consists of Classes and News Article in form of <br>
(Category, Article) in CSV file. We'll do Ensemble Learning <br>
and Predict Which Algo is Better for This Type of Problem <br>
<br><br>

Model 1 : Multilayer Perceptron<br>
MOdel 2 : Naive Bayes (multinomial NB)<br>
Model 3 : KNeighborsClassifier <br>
Model 4 : Decision Tree <br>
Model 5 : Random Forest <br>

Final Model : Bagging & Boosting <br> 
<br><br>
